This is a utility that extracts files out of QIC [1] files generated by MSBACKUP on Windows 98.

Motivation
==========

I initially tried this tool [2], however it has the following limitations:
1. Slow. It takes several minutes to extract data from a 120MB QIC file.
2. Sensitive to file corruption. My QIC file was stored on an LS120 floppy,
   which had a defective sector in the compressed data area of the QIC file.
   This resulted in all files following the corrupted sector to be garbled by that tool.

This recovery tool extracts files by grepping for various signatures in the data area.
This makes it robust for the type of corruption I ran into. It successfully 
extracted all files, except the one that got partially corrupted.

Limitations
===========
1. No support for other QIC files that the one I have.
2. Does not support more corruption types.
